Project Overview:
This project was undertaken by UC Davis Utility Headquarters to develop automation for fixing 1.2 million APJ files used on ArcGIS Server. The goal was to streamline the process of identifying and resolving issues within these files to ensure the efficient functioning of the ArcGIS Server system.

Automation Script:
I have developed an automation script specifically tailored to filter and fix the APJ files. The script performs the following tasks:

Filtering: The script identifies all APJ files within the specified directory.
Analysis: It analyzes each APJ file to detect any issues or errors.
Correction: The script automatically applies fixes to resolve identified issues within the APJ files.
Logging: Detailed logs are generated to track the process, including the files processed, errors encountered, and fixes applied.
Usage:
To utilize the automation script, follow these steps:

Place the script file in the directory containing the APJ files.
Execute the script using a Python interpreter or any compatible environment.
Monitor the script output and review the generated logs for insights into the process and any encountered errors.
Contributions:
This automation script is a result of dedicated effort and expertise in scripting and ArcGIS systems. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions for further improvements are welcome.

Disclaimer:
While the automation script aims to streamline the process of fixing APJ files, it is essential to validate the changes made and ensure compatibility with the ArcGIS Server environment before deploying in a production setting.
