# Project Overview

This project was initiated by UC Davis Utility Headquarters to develop an automation process for fixing 1.2 million APJ files used on the ArcGIS Server. The objective was to streamline the identification and resolution of issues within these files, ensuring the efficient functioning of the ArcGIS Server system.

## Automation Script

An automation script was developed specifically to filter and fix the APJ files. The script performs the following tasks:

- **Filtering**: Identifies all APJ files within the specified directory.
- **Analysis**: Analyzes each APJ file to detect any issues or errors.
- **Correction**: Automatically applies fixes to resolve identified issues within the APJ files.
- **Logging**: Generates detailed logs to track the process, including files processed, errors encountered, and fixes applied.

## Usage

To utilize the automation script, follow these steps:

1. Place the script file in the directory containing the APJ files.
2. Execute the script using a Python interpreter or any compatible environment.
3. Monitor the script output and review the generated logs for insights into the process and any encountered errors.

## Contributions

This automation script is a result of dedicated effort and expertise in scripting and ArcGIS systems. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions for further improvements are welcome.

## Disclaimer

While the automation script aims to streamline the process of fixing APJ files, it is essential to validate the changes made and ensure compatibility with the ArcGIS Server environment before deploying in a production setting.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to the team at UC Davis Utility Headquarters for their support and collaboration throughout the development of this automation solution.
